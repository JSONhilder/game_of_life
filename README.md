# THE GAME OF LIFE

Played on a 2-D grid.

Each square in the grid contains a cell, and each cell starts the game as either "alive" 1 or "dead" 0. 

## THE RULES
1. Any live cell with 0 or 1 live neighbors becomes dead, because underpopulation.

2. Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors stays alive! 

3. Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbors becomes dead, because overpopulation.

4. Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive, because reproduction.
